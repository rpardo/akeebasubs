    <p>
        Your recurring subscription to [LEVEL] has been canceled. You no longer have access to the downloads and support
        that came with it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The cancellation is the result of our reseller, Paddle Ltd, being unable to automatically charge you for the
        next installment of your subscription several times in a row.
    </p>
    <p>
        You have already received several emails from our reseller, Paddle, about the problem with your payment. If you
        need more information about it please contact them by replying to any of their emails.
    </p>
