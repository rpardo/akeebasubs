    Clicking on the renewal link in this email automatically applies the coupon code.<br/>
    The offer is limited time, non-transferable and cannot be exchanged for money, subscription time, services or anything else whatsoever.<br/>
    The offer is only valid when you use the coupon code during the self-service checkout on our site. It can not be applied retroactively or for manual payments (bank transfer) conducted with the help of our staff.<br/>
