    <h3>Renew early and get 40% off!</h3>
    <p>
        If you <a href="[RENEWALURL]">renew today</a> or at any time <strong>before your subscription's expiration at [PUBLISH_DOWN]</strong> you will get an <strong>automatic 40% discount</strong> off the listed price of the subscription if you renew for another full year.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alternatively, you can subscribe to a recurring (automatically billed) 3-month subscription which includes the renewal discount. The minimum time commitment in this case is just 3 months.
    </p>
    <p>
        In either case <strong>you do not lose any subscription time</strong>. Your renewal will start counting from [PUBLISH_DOWN] onwards.

    The two necessary conditions for receiving the discount or being eligible for the recurring 3-month subscription are:<br/>
    a. You are purchasing a [LEVEL] subscription. If you buy a subscription to a different product or a bundle this offer is void.<br/>
    b. You must complete the checkout (payment) for your [LEVEL] renewal purchase before [PUBLISH_DOWN].<br/>
    Both conditions must be fulfilled to receive the discount. You do not need to use a coupon code or special link.<br/>
    You need to log into our site with your username ([USERNAME]) to take advantage of this special offer.<br/>
    <em>You will not lose any subscription time by renewing early.</em> Your renewal will start counting after [PUBLISH_DOWN].<br/>
    The offer is limited time, non-transferable and cannot be exchanged for money, subscription time, services or anything else whatsoever.<br/>
    The offer is only valid when applied automatically during the self-service checkout on our site. It can not be applied retroactively or for manual payments (bank transfer) conducted with the help of our staff.<br/>
    If you believe you should be receiving this special offer during renewal but you are not please contact us <em>before</em> making a payment.<br/>
    Please note that the expiration date and time is expressed in the GMT timezone unless noted otherwise. If you'd like to use a different timezone please edit your user profile on our site.
