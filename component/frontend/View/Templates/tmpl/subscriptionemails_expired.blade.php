    You need to log into our site with your username ([USERNAME]) and enter the coupon code to take advantage of this special offer.<br/>
    Clicking on the renewal link in this email automatically applies the coupon code.<br/>
    The recurring (automatic billing) option is optional and additional to the regular, one year subscription renewal. If you choose this option you will be paying immediately for the first year of subscription. After the first year ends you will be automatically billed the recurring price and your subscription will be renewed for three months. This will keep going on every three months. You will receive a reminder email from our reseller, Paddle, 10 and 3 days prior to the automatic billing date. You can cancel your recurring subscription 24 hours prior to its billing date at the latest.<br/>
    The offer is limited time, non-transferable and cannot be exchanged for money, subscription time, services or anything else whatsoever.<br/>
    The offer is only valid when you use the coupon code during the self-service checkout on our site. It can not be applied retroactively or for manual payments (bank transfer) conducted with the help of our staff.<br/>
    If the special offer does not seem to work on the checkout page of our site please contact us <em>before</em> making a payment.
